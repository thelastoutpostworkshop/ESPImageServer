## Plan the Hugging Face major-version upgrade

Do not upgrade `transformers` 5.x or `huggingface-hub` 1.x independently.
Treat them as one planned upgrade with Diffusers and the supported image/video
models.

- Upgrade and test `diffusers`, `transformers`, and `huggingface-hub` together.
- Replace removed Hub 1.x `snapshot_download` options, especially
  `local_dir_use_symlinks=False` in `src/esp_image_server/video_generator.py`.
- Review Hub 1.x HTTP, proxy, and exception-handling changes before updating
  download progress or user-facing error messages.
- Confirm model downloads still work on Windows without Developer Mode or
  administrator privileges.
- Test image generation with DreamShaper, SSD-1B, SDXL, and SD-Turbo.
- Test video generation with LTX, Wan, and Hunyuan, including the saved-image
  first-frame path and model download/caching behavior.
- Run the backend test suite, frontend build, and a manual GPU smoke test for
  each model family before releasing the dependency upgrade.
